## Pupil Dataset
Dataset is created by taking videos of some our colleges. The dataset is made by observing and tracking seven different people's eye movement. 
The hard ware set up used to take video was a webcam that was tinkered to capture IR light and an IR lamp that helped illuminating the subject's pupil.
Camera: HP w100 (With IR-filter removed)
Lamp: 0603 Flat Top IR LED (4msW)

The dataset has differnt lighting conditions and the it was not fixed with the head. The images have some glare and occlusion. Spectales were removed.
